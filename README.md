Tried to clone Google notes app

1. Added Functionality like add and removes notes seamlessly.
2. Uses React Props to send and revice data between components, mapped data accoss components and structures.
3. Filtered Key and Id to implement delete functionality.
4. Used arrow functions to go thorugh arrays of data for better mapping.
5. Used React Hook States to control states of data for better coontrol and flow of data
6. Used Destructing for handling multiple values of data 
7. Handled events and used ES6 spred operatos to add data to existing data without losing any data
